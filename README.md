# weather-reporter

A weather report programmed with React 
The user enters the location in the input field and the program displays the temperature, precipitation and the relative humidity.
The data is provided by Open-Meteo and is updated every hour.

# How to use
Because the node_module folders are to large, you still have to install them manually.
To make React work you first need to create a React App
For that you require Node >= 14.0.0 and npm >= 5.6
 
 To create a project run
 
"npx create-react-app my-app"

now we also require MUI a React library

to install it open the terminal in the src folder

"npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled"

"npm install @mui/material @mui/styled-engine-sc styled-components"

"npm install @mui/icons-material"

After you have done that get out of the src folder

"cd .."

and type
"npm start"

now finally you can enjoy it
